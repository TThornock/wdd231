    <main>
        <section class="reason">
            <p>the reason I chose the name Celiac Travel Logs is beacuse I was orgianly going to just put together something with just disney in mind but with it being travel logs its keeps it open to adding diffrent pages for new locations I travel to.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="schema">
            <p>the schema I chose is blue</p>
            <p>some of the colors I chose are: #C7DFFF, #7CC2FF, and #78D4FF</p>
            <p>the reason I chose these colors is because my site focus on travels and thought using blue would be a good match for it as it matches the sky.
                aswell acording to the schema page it shows trust which is what I want to show.
            </p>

        <section class="typography">
            <p>I chose to use Merriweather serif and Kantumruy Pro sans-serif</p>

            <h2>My Goal</h2>
            <p>My goal is to give my expirences with traveling as someone who has been recently dignosed with celiac to help keep others informed. It is not an easy to be someone who has this and loves to travel but I hope my expirences help others as well.</p>
