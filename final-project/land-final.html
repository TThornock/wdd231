            <h2>Disney Land</h2>
            <p>I last visited the Disney Parks in California in August 2025, so some information may have changed since then. 
              I have divided this page into sections covering the parks and Downtown Disney. 
              I chose to do this because I believe Downtown Disney is an important part of the overall experience, 
              and it is also home to several notable restaurants.</p>

            <h2>In Disney Land Parks</h2>
            <p class="info">Within the parks, I would note that suitable food options can sometimes be harder to find, but there are certainly a few standout choices.</p>
            <picture><img src="images/pym-break.jpg" alt="Quantum Breakfast From Pym's Test Kitchen" loading="lazy"></picture>
            <p class="exp">The locations I would recommend as reliable dining options are Pym`s Test Kitchen in Hollywood Studios, the Carnation Café in Magic Kingdom, and Café Orleans. 
              My personal favorite was Pym`s, which offered the best gluten-free bread by far. Although the menu was somewhat limited, the available options were excellent. 
              Unfortunately, I would suggest skipping the Star Wars themed restaurants, as they were not nearly as good as their counterparts in Florida.

            <h2>Downtown Disney</h2>
            <p class="info">Downtown Disney is the street nestled between the two California parks and is home to several gift shops, as well as a wide variety of restaurants and food stalls.</p>
            <picture><img src="images/salad.jpg" alt="Salad from Jazz Kitchen Coastal" loading="lazy"></picture>
            <p class="exp">During my visit to Downtown Disney, I did not get to explore a wide range of dining options, but one restaurant truly stood out is Jazz Kitchen Coastal. 
              The staff were incredibly kind and attentive, going out of their way to help me find gluten-free choices. 
              I ordered the gumbo, which is normally served with pasta, but they happily swapped it for rice—an easy 10/10 in my book. 
              An option for those with a sweet tooth is Salt and Straw ice cream shop many of which are gluten-free or cater to other dietary needs.
